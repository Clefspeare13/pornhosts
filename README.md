# pornhosts -- a consolidated anti porn hosts file

This is an endeavour to find all porn domains and compile them into a
single hosts to allow for easy blocking of porn on your local machine or
on a network.

In order to add this to your machine, copy the
[hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clefspeare13/pornhosts/master/download_here/0.0.0.0/hosts),
and add it to your ```hosts``` file which can be found in the following
locations

macOS X, iOS, Android, Linux: `/etc/hosts` folder.

Windows: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` folder.

There are teen ```hosts``` files in this repo, which uses ```0.0.0.0```
and ```127.0.0.1```. If you are not sure which is right, use ```0.0.0.0```
as it is faster and will run on essentially all machines.   
However, if you know what you're doing and need a ```127.0.0.1```
version, it is available

[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clefspeare13/pornhosts/master/download_here/127.0.0.1/hosts)

Additionally, there is a new hosts file which will force Safe Search in
Bing and Google, however it has not been tested yet. It can be found
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clefspeare13/pornhosts/master/download_here/safesearch/0.0.0.0/hosts)

For any other lists, please the [README](https://github.com/Clefspeare13/pornhosts/blob/master/download_here/README.md)
