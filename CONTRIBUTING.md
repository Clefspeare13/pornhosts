# Contributing

If you feel like contributing there are a couple of ways to do this

1. You can add new super high speed bash code, optimizing existing code
   or rewrite for broader support of bash environments across OS's

1. You can add domains within the `submit_here` folder of this repo.

1. Please add you contribution to either the vary beginning of the file
   or the bottom, the CI/CD will do the sorting.

# Committing new domain(s)
There is a couple scenarios for this (Preferred order):

## The fast commit approach
1. You either open a ISSUE(Preferred) or commits directly via PR
   
   Basic rule is **One domain = one issue or PR**, including subdomains
   
   You fill the template **screenshot required**

1. @spirillen will handle these on a regular basis, which usual
   would be a couple of times a week.

### The slow approach
If any of these conditions is present you are left hanging for
@Clefspeare13 to come around.

1. You punch in a undocumented [Bulk list](https://github.com/Clefspeare13/pornhosts/labels/Bulk%20submission)
   and wait's for @Clefspeare13 to come around (Last seen May 05, 2020)

1. You fail to fill the issue/PR templates...

1. You commits more than one domain (incl subdomains) per ISSUE/PR...

## Screenshot
Why @spirillen is so picky about the screenshots is do to the time
available for him to to handle this.

### Notes
@spirillen is solely "Santa's little helper" within this project and a
good list have reasons for why and documentation, and are open for
argumentation.

The other thing is, @spirillen is the friendly neighborhood spider with
these adult related lists, personally he have no issues with the subject,
but he accept that some people might have, do to personal reasons or it
just got to much some places, this leaving it a low priority to me vs his
anti-tracking (privacy) project and @funilrys's
[PyFunceble](https://github.com/funilrys/pyfunceble) and that's makes it
impossible for him to visit every single domain coming in from bulk list
to determine which is correct and which isn't, he the screenshot comes
into play as it says it all.

That said, all "correctly" filed issues will end up in 3(4) different
projects when he submit them by his private scripts (it's yet private do
to API-keys to various servers), so whether you issue the domains here
at <https://github.com/Clefspeare13/pornhosts> or to
[mypdns.org](https://www.mypdns.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/2/) for the
(issues) and [the git](https://github.com/mypdns/porn-domains) is the same
for me :smiley:

IP submissions can only go to the last mentioned :smirk: as you can't
block ip addresses by using hosts files, you'll need either
[DNS RPZ](https://www.mypdns.org/w/rpz/) or a firewall for that
